YOUR STATUS AND SAFETY
The themes and contents of our site are intended for adult players (over 18 years old), not recommended for children. There is content with descriptions of violence (with blood), drug or alcohol use, sexual references and obscene language. We advise parents who permit their children to use our site that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online. Minors who are using the site should be made aware of the potential risks to them and of their obligation to comply with these terms of website use when using the site. You should never reveal any personal information about yourself or anyone else (for example, your email address or full name) and you should proceed with care and judgement when using our site.

PROHIBITED USES
You may use our site only for lawful purposes. You may not use our site:
- In any way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation;

    - any part of our site;

INTERACTIVE SERVICES
We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:
- Wiki;
- Chat rooms;
- Sending e-mail for site-exclusive content. Note: Users' email is not disclosed and other users will not be able to use it to send content of any kind;
- Bulletin boards; and
- Vectortowns World Room (iterative room where players interact with each other);

Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical). We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not. The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
